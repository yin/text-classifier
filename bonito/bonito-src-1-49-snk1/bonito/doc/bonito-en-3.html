<P>This chapter explains all of the menu items.  
<B>-&gt;Menu-&gt;Item</B> is used in this text to denote a menu
item <EM>Item</EM> from the menu <EM>Menu</EM>.  For example menu item
<EM>Connection</EM> from the <EM>Manager</EM> menu is denoted by
<B>-&gt;Manager-&gt;Connection</B></P>

</H2>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Connection</B><DD><P>Establishes connection to the server.  It is
not possible to work with corpora without a connection.  It
is possible to connect to either a remote server through the
Internet/intranet or to launch the server locally.  If the
Internet connection is not set in the configuration, an
automatic connection is performed once Bonito is launched.
Otherwise this menu item is automatically selected
and it is necessary to enter the user's name and password in
the displayed window.</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Internet connection</B><DD><P>The connection is performed to a
remote server, the address of which is in the entry box
<EM>Server address</EM>.  <EM>User name</EM> and
<EM>password</EM> are required.</P>

<DT><B>Run local</B><DD><P>If you select this option, the server runs
locally, that is, in the same computer as Bonito, and the whole
manager and all corpora to be used have to be installed in this
computer.  The user's name and password are ignored.  The access to
the selected corpora is determined by the permissions of the corpus
data files.  For the server launch the command in the <EM>Server
command</EM> entry box is used.</P>

<DT><B>Server address</B><DD><P>The address of the computer which the server is running on
e.g. aurora.fi.muni.cz.</P>

<DT><B>User name, Password</B><DD><P>User's login and password.  These
can be different from user's login and/or password on the
server.  Password characters are not displayed in the entry box.</P>

<DT><B>Server command</B><DD><P>The command for the local server
launch. (e.g. manateesrv "desam susanne" 2>errlog).</P>

</DL>
</P>

<DT><B>Change password</B><DD><P>Changes the user's password.  The old
password entry is required and the new password entry is required
twice.  Password characters are not displayed in the entry boxes.</P>

<DT><B>Refresh Result</B><DD><P>Redraws the contents of the result box
according to the assignment in <B>-&gt;Display-&gt;Range</B>).  </P>

<DT><B>Options</B><DD><P>Displays window with user's options for
start-up or saving options for the next start-up.  Default option
values are set to suit most users.  Advanced users may change the
following options:
<UL>
<LI><EM>Help hits</EM> -- corresponds with the menu item
<B>-&gt;Help-&gt;Show</B> help hits
</LI>
<LI><EM>Browser command (for on-line help)</EM> -- this
command performs the WWW browser start-up with the documentation
page.  It is used for displaying on-line
help. (<B>-&gt;Help-&gt;Documentation</B>).
</LI>
<LI><EM>Maximum number of undo steps</EM> -- see menu 
<B>-&gt;Concordance-&gt;Undo</B>
</LI>
<LI><EM>Number of queries in the history</EM>
</LI>
<LI><EM>Number of "new" lines in Page-Up/Page-Down</EM> -- see menu
<B>-&gt;View-&gt;Page up</B> and <B>-&gt;View-&gt;Page down</B> 
</LI>
<LI><EM>Number of lines read per batch during display</EM> -- the
concordance lines display runs continuously after the number
of lines is assigned as the data from server are being
received.  If you have a fast (new) computer, the total display
of many rows (more than 1000) may be accelerated.  A
higher value must be set.  The acceleration shows itself only if
there is a sufficient amount of data from the server.  Thus, if you
have a slow connection to the server (connection via modem), or if
you entered a complicated query which has to be evaluated slowly, Bonito
always displays only the rows the server provides---option
modification will have no influence on the speed of the displaying
process.  
</LI>
<LI><EM>Internet server connection</EM> -- when checked, the
radio button <EM>Internet connection</EM> will be selected in the login
window.  Otherwise, the option <EM>Run local</EM> will be selected.
</LI>
<LI><EM>Server address, Server port number</EM> -- the computer Internet
address and the port number of the server on which the server part
of the Manager is running.  
   </LI>
<LI><EM>Default corpus</EM> -- after connecting to the server the first
available corpus is set.  If you mostly work with another corpus,
enter its name into this entry box and <B>Save</B>.  When you connect
next time, the assigned corpus will be set.  The given name should
match a corpus name exactly including character case.
</LI>
<LI><EM>Default context size</EM> -- see menu
<B>-&gt;View-&gt;Context</B> 
</LI>
<LI><EM>Default display range</EM> -- see menu
<B>-&gt;View-&gt;Range</B></LI>
</UL>

If you use the <B>Apply</B> button, set values are valid only until the
application exits.  Button Save performs not only setting values
for the current application -- it also saves them into a configuration
file and these values will be used when you next start the
application.  Some values (<EM>Default ...</EM>) are reasonable only
for saving.</P>


<DT><B>Change language</B><DD><P>You can select the language of the
user interface here.  The selected language is the default one for
next startups.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2</A> <A HREF="bonito-en.html#toc3.2">Corpus</A>
</H2>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Information summary</B><DD><P>Displays the information summary
of the selected corpus: its name and additional information from the
corpus configuration file, size (number of positions), all attributes
and structure tags.  The size of vocabulary is displayed (number of
entries) for each attribute; that is, the number of different words
(types), number of different lemmata, tags etc. -- according to the
attribute.  For each structure tag the number of its occurrences in
the corpus is displayed.</P>

<DT><B>Statistics</B><DD><P>Basic statistical values are computed for
given attribute values: the number of occurrences in the whole corpus,
number of occurrences of the whole bigram, the mutual
information (MI) score and T-score.</P>

<P>Bigram occurrences are computed according to a given span (window).
Default values <EM>from 1 to 1</EM> mean that the second word is
to directly follow the first one.  Values <EM>from 1 to 5</EM>
means the size of a span is 5, i.e.  there can be up to 4
positions between the first word and the second one.  A minus sign
means the inverted order of the word occurrence.  Thus <EM>from -1
to -1</EM> means that the second word is to directly precede the
first one. <EM>From -5 to 5</EM> then means that there can be
a maximum distance of 5 positions between the words and that the
words can be in an arbitrary order.</P>

<DT><B>Create subcorpus</B><DD><P>Creates a subcorpus from the selected corpus according to given
conditions.  Subcorpora can be used only for queries.  Any statistics
computation uses the whole corpus.
<DL>
<DT><B>Base corpus</B><DD><P>The name the corpus from which a subcorpus will be created.
This is the selected corpus from the main Bonito window.</P>
<DT><B>Subcorpus name</B><DD><P>After a successful subcorpus creation a new corpus will be added
to the list of available corpora.  The name of the new corpus will
be in the form <EM>base corpus</EM>:<EM>subcorpus name</EM>.  For
example, if the current corpus is <EM>susanne</EM> and we create a
subcorpus named <EM>press</EM>  there will be
<EM>susanne:press</EM> in the corpus list.</P>
<DT><B>Structure</B><DD><P>The name of a structure tag (structure
attribute) used for subcorpus.   In the subcorpus there will be
only positions included in the structure of this name which
fulfils the given condition.  Subcorpora are typically created
from the top structures which represents documents or texts.</P>
<DT><B>Conditions</B><DD><P>This condition restricts attribute(s) of the structure to certain
values.  For example, in the Susanne corpus the <EM>press
reportage</EM> genre is in texts with names beginning by
<EM>A</EM>.  Texts names are stored in the <EM>file</EM> attribute
of the <EM>&lt;doc&gt;</EM> structure in Bonito.  Then the condition
for a `press reportage' subcorpus is:
<HR>
<PRE>
file = "A.."

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Evaluate</B><DD><P>Performs an evaluation of the given query (or
P-filter, N-filter, or collocation, see Chapter 4).  The evaluation
itself is performed on the server: Bonito only receives the
result.  When the function is activated, a <B>Stop</B> button
appears to the right of the corpus name.  This button enables the
current action to be canceled.</P>

<DT><B>List of named queries</B><DD><P>Displays the list of named
queries.  A user can select a query for an evaluation or delete a
selected query from the list.</P>

<DT><B>List of templates</B><DD><P>Displays the list of templates (see
Chapter 5 -- Templates).  A user can select a template for an
evaluation, delete a selected template from the list, add a new
template or change the text or the description of a selected template.</P>

concordance contain the most frequent words.</P>

<DT><B>Line group sort</B><DD><P>Sorts concordance lines according to group numbers.  Groups are
sorted in ascending order (the first group has number 1), at the
end of the concordance there are lines without group assignment.</P>

<DT><B>Undo</B><DD><P>Undoes the last change.  It displays the previous
concordance.  A user can cancel the last change (reduction, deletion,

<H3>Concordance->Statistics</H3>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Frequency distribution</B><DD><P>Counts the frequency of words or other attributes, or their sequences
in the requested positions.
<DL>
<DT><B>Limit</B><DD><P>Only sequences with frequency higher than the
entered limit will be included in the result.  The default limit of 0
means that all values will be counted.  For concordance lists with a
large number of lines, the full result can mean a large amount of data
being passed from the server and sorted.</P>
<P>Displaying them can take a long time if more than several thousand
lines are to be displayed, depending on the computer performance.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>Every condition contains:
<DL>
<DT><B>Attribute</B><DD><P>The attribute name (selected from the corpus
positional attributes)</P>

<DT><B>Position</B><DD><P>The position which will be compared.</P>
</DL>

The list works in the same way as the Generic sort.  After pressing
the <B>OK</B> button, the computation is executed and the result window
is displayed.</P>
<P>It is possible to further change the way the results are displayed.
This can be done using the following controls:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Limit</B><DD><P>Lines with a frequency less or equal to the
entered limit are not displayed in the result.  The number of displayed
lines is always counted and shown alongside.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>There are three possibilities for each entered position to be chosen:
<DL>
<DT><B>Show</B><DD><P>Words will be displayed in the normal way.</P>

<DT><B>Sum</B><DD><P>Words will be displayed and their subtotal will be
displayed.  For the last position, the options <B>Show</B> and
<B>Sum</B> are identical because the sum is always counted for that
position.</P>

<DT><B>Hide</B><DD><P>Words will not be counted or displayed at all.</P>
</DL>

After every change of limit or display settings a new result display
is performed.  The width of the individual columns can be adjusted by
dragging the column header with the left mouse button.</P>


<DT><B>Collocations</B><DD><P>Computes the most important
collocations in the given context according to the following
parameters:
<DL>
<DT><B>Attribute</B><DD><P>The attribute name: selected from
positional attributes</P>

<DT><B>In the range from, to</B><DD><P>The initial or terminal
context position.  Positive values are counted to the right from the
end of KWIC, negative values are counted from the beginning of KWIC to
the left.</P>

<DT><B>Minimum frequency in corpus</B><DD><P>Statistics will be counted only
for the words whose total frequency in the corpus is higher than the
entered frequency.</P>

<DT><B>Minimum frequency in given range</B><DD><P>Statistics will be counted
only for the words whose total frequency in the given context is
higher than the entered frequency.</P>

<DT><B>Maximum number of displayed lines</B><DD><P>If there are more lines
in the result, only the given number of the highest scored is
displayed.</P>

<DT><B>Sort according to frequency</B><DD><P>Determines the type of sort
according to which the result lines will be displayed.  This applies
only to the selection of the most frequent lines (see previous
parameter): displayed lines can be then sorted according to an
arbitrary column.</P>
<P>The absolute frequency sort is similar to the T-score and
the relative frequency sort is identical with the
MI-score (see details below).</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>The result is displayed in table form.  The table can be saved to file
by pressing the <B>Save</B> button.  The table can be sorted
according to an arbitrary column if you right mouse click on the
header of the required column.</P>
<P>The meaning of the values in the individual columns follows:
<DL>
<DT><B>First column</B><DD><P>The first column is named according to the
name of the counted attribute (e.g. <EM>word</EM>).  It contains the
values of the given attribute for which the statistics were counted.</P>

<DT><B>MI-score</B><DD><P>The mutual information of a word and a concordance.</P>

<DT><B>T-score</B><DD><P>The T-score of a word and a concordance</P>

<DT><B>Rel. f</B><DD><P>The relative frequency of a word, i.e. the percentage of all
the occurrences of the word in the given context.</P>

<DT><B>Abs. f</B><DD><P>The absolute frequency of a word, i.e. how often a word
occurred in the given context.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>A right mouse button click on a word in the first column displays a
menu containing two items: <EM>P-filter</EM> and <EM>N-filter</EM>.
An activation of one of these items apply the appropriate filter on
the current concordance. </P>

<DT><B>Distribution overview</B><DD><P>A window is displayed in
which the number of lines of result (frequency) and the so-called
reduced frequency can be seen.  Further it shows a graphical
representation of
the distribution of the individual result lines within the whole
corpus.  Axis <EM>X</EM> shows the individual corpus positions, and
<EM>Y</EM> shows the number of occurrences in the given position in
corpus.</P>
<P>If the individual lines of a concordance list are evenly distributed
within the whole corpus, the individual lines in the graph are of the same length
and are displayed evenly along the whole window length.  If, conversely,
most lines are from ``one'' part of the corpus (e.g. from one
document) there are distinctly more longer lines in one part of the
window.</P>
<P>It is possible to ``jump'' to the selected part of the corpus by
clicking on a line under the mouse cursor.  </P>
