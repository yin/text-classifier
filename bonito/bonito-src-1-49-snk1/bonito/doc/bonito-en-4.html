<P> The user can enter a real query in the query language or a
template (see below) into the query entry-box.  A query consists of at
least two parts: query type (selected from the menu in the upper-left
corner) and query text or template (put into the first entry box).</P>
<P>A query type is one of the following:
<DL>
<DT><B>New Query</B><DD><P>creates a new concordance list for further
modifications (filtering, reduction, sorting, ...).
<B>Ctrl-Q</B> also selects this type.</P>

<DT><B>P-filter</B><DD><P>Positive filter -- only matching lines remain
in the concordance list.  <B>Ctrl-P</B> selects P-filter.</P>

<DT><B>N-filter</B><DD><P>Negative filter -- matching lines are removed
from the concordance list.  <B>Ctrl-N</B> selects N-filter.</P>

<DT><B>collocation</B><DD><P>Matching positions are highlighted in the
given interval of each line.</P>
</DL>

P/N-filter and collocation query types need an interval within which to
search matching positions for each line.  The interval is given by
its first and last positions.</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>First/Last</B><DD><P>For collocations specifies which occurrence in
the given interval should be considered a collocation.</P>

<DT><B>From, To:</B><DD><P>The start and the end of an interval for P/N filter,
or for the search of collocation.</P>
<P>The number specifies a count of units.  Positive numbers mean the count
of units to the right, after the specified reference
position.  Negative numbers mean the count of units to the left,
before the specified reference position.  Number 0 means exactly the
given position.  A unit is, according to the selection, either a position
or a structure tag.  The last selection button <EM>From</EM> specifies
the reference position from which the given number of units will be
counted.  A value can be chosen from the following:
<DL>
<DT><B>&lt;KWIC</B><DD><P>-- from the beginning of the words found</P>

<DT><B>KWIC&gt;</B><DD><P>-- from the end of the words found</P>

<DT><B>&lt;n.coll.</B><DD><P>-- from the beginning of the n-th collocation</P>

<DT><B>n.coll.&gt;</B><DD><P>-- from the end of the n-th collocation</P>
</DL>
</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>Note:
Every entered query is saved in the query history.  It is not saved however,
if the query itself and its name are identical with
the previous query.  It is possible to use cursor up/down arrows in the
entry box of the query to go through the history.</P>
<P>If a query name is entered into the entry box following the query, the
query is saved into the list of named queries.</P>
<P>The list of named queries, the list of templates and history are
automatically saved when the application is closed.
