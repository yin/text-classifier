<P>Bonito is a graphical user interface (GUI) of a Manatee corpus
manager.  It enables queries to be formed and given to various
corpora.  The results are clearly displayed and can be changed in
various ways.  Statistics can also be computed on them.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1</A> <A HREF="bonito-en.html#toc1.1">Corpus</A>
</H2>

<P>A Corpus is here defined as a sequence of so-called positions.  Each
position is made up of one word, number or punctuation mark, etc.  The
actual division into individual positions is performed automatically
by external tools in most corpora and does not depend on Manatee or
Bonito systems in any way.  This may be different in various corpora.</P>
<P>Each position consists of a set of positional attributes.  Each
attribute contains a piece of simple word information (a word, a basic
form, a part of speech, etc.).  The position of an optional corpus
always contains a minimum of one attribute with name <EM>word</EM>.  The
attribute contains an actual word at the given position.  Different
corpora contain different sets of attributes.  Some corpora contain
only the attribute mentioned above.  Others contain a word, the basic
form of the word (attribute <EM>lemma</EM>) and grammatical
information (attribute <EM>tag</EM>).  Some corpora contain grammatical
information divided into more specific attributes.</P>
<P>The corpus may also contain various structure tags, such as sentence
boundaries, paragraph or document boundaries.  Certain types of tags
may also contain additional information.  Thus in many corpora the
whole text is divided into documents by the structure tag &lt;doc&gt;.
This structure tag usually contains the document source identifier.</P>
<P>In some annotated corpora grammatical information stored for each word is
often denoted as a tag.  This type of information, however, does not stand
for the structure tags mentioned above.  These tags (grammatical
information) are stored in some of the positional attributes.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2</A> <A HREF="bonito-en.html#toc1.2">Corpus manager</A>
</H2>

<P>The corpus query result is the so-called concordance list that
creates all corpus positions corresponding with the query given.  The
concordance list is then displayed in KWIC (Key Word(s) In Context)
format.  The searched words are displayed with their contexts one below
the other.  The concordance list is sometimes abbreviated as
concordance.  The abbreviation KWIC represents the searched word or a
word sequence.</P>
