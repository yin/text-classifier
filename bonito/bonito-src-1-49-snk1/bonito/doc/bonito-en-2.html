<P>There is a menu in the upper part of the manager's main window and there
is an entry box for making queries below the window.  On the right at
the end of the entry line there is a button with a current corpus
name.  It is possible to select a different corpus from the displayed
list after clicking on the button and holding the mouse button.</P>
<P>Most of the window area is formed by the concordance list where query
results are displayed.  In the lower part there is the area of detail
where a selected KWIC with a larger context is displayed.  It is
possible to zoom in the context interactively: <B>Up Arrow</B>
enlarges the context to the left, <B>Down Arrow</B> to the right.
There is a status line on the lowest border of the main window.  It
informs the user about the operation which is currently in progress.
If there is no operation in progress, it informs the user about
the lines displayed.</P>
<P>Information about the displayed lines is beside the word
<EM>Displayed</EM> and it has one of the following forms:
<UL>
<LI> If all the result lines are displayed, <EM>All</EM> is written in
the status line.  The word is followed by a slash (/) and the number of
lines (e.g. <EM>All/13</EM>).  
</LI>
<LI> If only a part of the result is displayed, the information
about the displayed lines seems more complicated at first
(e.g. <EM>141+50/363 (13%)</EM>).  The first number (before the + symbol) shows
the number of the first displayed line.  The number of displayed lines
follows and there is the total number of lines behind the slash
(/).  In brackets there is the percentage of the displayed lines of the
total number of all result lines.  The example shown above can be read
in the following way: from the 141st line 50 lines are displayed out
of the total 363, which is 13%.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The status line beside the word <EM>Line</EM> contains the number of the
current line and if a line is selected, the word <EM>Selected</EM> is followed
by the number of selected lines.</P>
<P>It is possible to use the tabulator key for moving between the
individual entry boxes of the query, the concordance list and the
detail.  The <B>F12</B> key switches between the concordance list and
the entry box of the query.  Space bar on a menu-button shows a menu
with all possible values.</P>
