1 Personal life

Born in Osaka Prefecture, he was raised in Tottori Prefecture from the age of four. According to an interview conducted by Japan Inc., he was a self-taught programmer until the end of high school.[1] He graduated with an information science degree from University of Tsukuba, where he was a member of Ikuo Nakata's research lab on programming languages and compilers. Matsumoto is married and has four children. He is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, did standard service as a missionary and is now a counselor in his church ward.[2]
2 Work
2.1 Ruby

Matz released the first version of the Ruby programming language on 21 December 1995[3][4] and he is still leading the development effort on the reference implementation often called MRI for Matz Ruby Implementation.
2.2 mruby

In April 2012, Matz open-sourced his work on a new implementation of the Ruby language called: mruby [5][6] , a minimal implementation based on his VM called ritevm and which is designed to allow software developers to embed Ruby in other programs while keeping memory footprint small and performance optimized.
